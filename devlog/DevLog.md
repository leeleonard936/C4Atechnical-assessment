## Installs
installed angular material to make building the front end easier

## Routing
First attempted to route to a new hero page using ts, then opted to use routerlink in the html page.

used this documentation to determine the best way to send hero data to the viewhero page https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/angular-query-parameters

## Issue #1
Ran into an issue when attempting to inject a typescript variable into html, did not realize it was as easy as it is. I was attempting to add brackets around the variable name when i did not need to.
