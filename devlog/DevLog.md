# Devlog

## Plans

I plan to do all 4 of the front end tasks


## Installs
installed angular material to make building the front end easier

## Initial test
I manually added a hero named arthur to the hero array in the backend to test my code for the first frontend challenge

## Routing
First attempted to route to a new hero page using ts, then opted to use routerlink in the html page.

used this documentation to determine the best way to send hero data to the viewhero page https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/angular-query-parameters

## Issue #1
Ran into an issue when attempting to inject a typescript variable into html, did not realize it was as easy as it is. I was attempting to add brackets around the variable name when i did not need to.

## Issue #2
Matformfield will not show until clicked. I do not know how to fix this and none of the documentation has any hints, nothing on stackoverflow either
